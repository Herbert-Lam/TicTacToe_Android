This is an academic lab assignment of Android mobile application development course. I spent around 4 hours to complete this lab assignment.

This lab assignment requires me to create a Tic-Tac-Toe app that allows users to play on the Android device. 2D arrays are used to manage the 9 buttons for simplifying the codes.
